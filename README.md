# UCI_HeartDisease_Classification
This notebook explores the UCI Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle, performs data cleaning, and feature engineering. Then uses 5 classification models (LR, SVC, DT, RF, XGB) to predict heart disease. Finally, we increase interpretability using various methods including Global Model and SHAP.
